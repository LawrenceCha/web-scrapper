# Web Scraper

This is a Python web scraping program that utilizes BeautifulSoup, a powerful library for parsing HTML and json documents. With this web scraper, you can extract data from websites by crawling through their pages and parsing the desired content.

## How it Works

Web scraping involves automatically extracting information from websites. Here's how this web scraper works:

1. **Crawling:** The program accesses web pages on the internet, usually starting from a specified URL, and retrieves the HTML content of those pages.

2. **Parsing:** BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content, allowing the program to navigate through the structure of the webpage and extract specific data elements, such as text, links, images, and more.

3. **Data Extraction:** Once the desired data elements are identified within the HTML structure, the scraper extracts and processes them according to predefined rules.

4. **Output:** The extracted data can be saved to a file, stored in a database, or used for further analysis and processing.
